# Quantum_Algorithmic_Trading
Uncorrelated sandbox strategies where each program leverages opposing quantum techniques; Quantum solving problem of maximizing market efficiency and liquidity, applied where there is proven quantum advantage (i.e. Quantum Infinite States, Quantum-Classical Hybrid Modeling, Quantum Machine Learning for Quantum Error Correction (QML-QEC), Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimizer (QUBO), etc).
